"Today I Learned" is a collection of insights and bits of knowledge I gather daily, primarily focused on software engineering, books I’m reading, and podcasts I’m listening to.

I believe the best way to learn is by capturing and sharing what I discover. Even if it’s just a small piece of knowledge each day, these insights can build up over time, leading to meaningful growth.

This project is also inspired by [Jake Lazaroff's TIL project](https://til.jakelazaroff.com/).
